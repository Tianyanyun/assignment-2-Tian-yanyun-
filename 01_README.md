# Section 3-how you performed OCR and how you cleaned the text
I used the computer system to take screenshots of the book content, and then uploaded the photos to Google Drive. Next step, I opened the photos using **Google Docs**. Last but not least, I arranged all the content into one text.

# Section 4-what you learned from the qualitative and quantitative analysis 
From the qualitative analysis. I understand this story's theme, narrative, and the emotions of the characters.
From the quantitative analysis, which shows some word counts and frequency to reflect the story's plot development. It uses a digital way to help the reader to understand the story's trend.
